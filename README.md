Ratings and Reviews
TODO: All review data used in my section is DUMMY DATA that I wrote so I could edit it freely myself! There are no API/axios calls implemented.
TODO: The real data might be formatted slightly differently from my dummy data. For example, integers might actually come in string form.
TODO: The button to mark a review as helpful should only be clickable once per user. This is already implemented in the QA section, but not here.
TODO: Reviews with images attached should display those images as thumbnails that open the image, enlarged, in a modal when clicked.
TODO: Users should be able to upload images with their reviews.
TODO: Submitting a review should not work unless the required fields are filled out. This includes checking the validity of the email address.
TODO (lower priority): There should be a searchbar and selectable filters to sort the reviews.
